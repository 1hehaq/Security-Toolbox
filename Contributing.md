# General

All github flows must be apprioprately named. The readme also needs to be updated to reflect the new addition of a new tool, please follow the existing format. All external references must be linked.  

# Python

All python libraries will be stored in one requirments for ease of caching, however if you are leveraging an old library that does not support python 3.x, then please use a different file in the repo root to install the dependency (see Ciphey example)  

# YAML

Do not add excessive actions to the code if it is not necessary, for example, do not git checkout if there is nothing in the repo being leveraged for the workflow.  
Example Inputs must reflect a real world payload example.
